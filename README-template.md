## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

-Semantic HTML5 markup

-CSS custom properties

-Flexbox for layout

-Mobile-first CSS workflow

-Plain JavaScript (No frameworks used)

### What I learned

Working on this contact form challenge helped me deepen my understanding of both frontend development and form validation. Some of the key things I learned include:

-Form validation using JavaScript: I learned how to validate user inputs, show custom error messages, and highlight invalid fields to guide the user.

-Radio button selection and styling: I now know how to change the visual state of a radio button container (label) when selected, not just the radio button itself.

-Creating a success message (toast): I implemented a small success message box with a green background, check icon, and dynamic feedback after successful form submission.

-CSS transitions and styling: I improved my ability to use CSS to create subtle hover effects, input focus states, and conditional styling for valid and invalid fields.

-Positioning elements correctly: I learned how to make a success message appear above the form, centered and not full-width, for better user experience.

-Working with accessibility considerations: I used proper labels and aria roles to ensure the form can be navigated using a screen reader or keyboard.

### Continued development

In the future, I plan to:

-Explore using JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue for more dynamic form handling.

-Improve the design and functionality by introducing animations for form transitions and success/error messages.

-Experiment with integrating backend solutions to handle form submissions and user data.
